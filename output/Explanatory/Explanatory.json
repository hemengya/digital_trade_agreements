(b) The Parties shall endeavour to take into account, for relevant payment systems, internationally accepted payment standards to enable greater interoperability between payment systems.   (c) The Parties shall endeavour to promote the use of Application Programming Interface (API) and to encourage financial institutions and payment service providers to make available APIs of their financial products, services and transactions to third party players where possible to facilitate greater interoperability and innovation in the electronic-payments ecosystem.   (d) The Parties shall endeavour to enable cross-border authentication and electronic know-your-customer of individuals and businesses using digital identities.  (e) The Parties recognise the importance of upholding safety, efficiency, trust and security in electronic payment systems through regulation.  The implementation of regulation should, where appropriate, be proportionate to and commensurate with the risks posed by the provision of electronic payment systems.    (f) The Parties agree that policies should promote innovation and competition in a level playing field and recognise the importance of enabling the introduction of new financial and electronic payment products and services by incumbents and new entrants in a timely manner such as through adopting regulatory and industry sandboxes.   3-1",

To that end, a Party may establish an appropriate role for the government that does not impair the timeliness of the process provided in paragraphs 3 and 4, and does not entail advance government review of each individual notice.(157) For greater certainty, a notice of alleged infringement, as may be set out under a Party's law, must contain information that: (a) is reasonably sufficient to enable the Internet Service Provider to identify the work, performance or phonogram claimed to be infringed, the alleged infringing material, and the online location of the alleged infringement; and (b) has a sufficient indicia of reliability with respect to the authority of the person sending the notice.(158) With respect to the function in subparagraph 2(b), a Party may limit the requirements of paragraph 3 related to an Internet Service Provider removing or disabling access to material to circumstances in which the Internet Service Provider becomes aware or receives notification that the cached material has been removed or access to it has been disabled at the originating site.(159) For greater certainty, the Parties understand that, \"any interested party\" may be limited to those with a legal interest recognised under that Party's law.",
