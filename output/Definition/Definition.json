    "content": "Understanding on Computer Services To the extent that trade in computer services is liberalised in accordance with Chapters 2 (Establishment), 3 (Cross-Border Supply of Services) and 4 (Temporary Presence of Natural Persons for Business Purposes), the Parties subscribe to the understanding set out in the following subparagraphs: (a) the CPC 84 code, used for describing computer and related services, covers the basic functions used to provide all computer and related services: computer programmes defined as the sets of instructions required to make computers work and communicate (including their devel­opment and implementation), data processing and storage, and related services, such as consultancy and training services for staff of clients. Technological developments have led to the increased offering of these services as a bundle or package of related services that can include some or all of these basic functions. For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic computer services functions; (b) computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered via a network, including the Internet, include all services that provide: (i) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, inte­gration, testing, debugging, updating, support, technical assistance, or management of or for computers or computer systems; (ii) computer programmes defined as the sets of instructions required to make computers work and communicate (in and of themselves), plus consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, devel­opment, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical assistance, management or use of or for computer programmes; (iii) data processing, data storage, data hosting or database services; (iv) maintenance and repair services for office machinery and equipment, including computers; or (v) training services for staff of clients related to computer programmes, computers or computer systems, and not classified elsewhere; (c) computer and related services enable the provision of other services (e.g. banking) by both electronic and other means. However, there is an important distinction between the enabling service (e.g. web-hosting or application hosting) and the content or core service that is being delivered elec­tronically (e.g. banking). In such cases, the content or core service is not covered by the CPC 84 code. S e c t i o n 3 P o s t a l a n d c o u r i e r s e r v i c e s",
